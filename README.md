The File Integrity Checker is a Python GUI application that allows users to check the integrity of files by calculating their MD5 and SHA256 hashes. It is useful for malware analysis or verifying the integrity of important files.

Features
*   Upload two files and calculate their MD5 and SHA256 hashes.
*   Compare the hashes of the two files and display a warning if changes are detected.
*   Simple and user-friendly GUI interface.

Prerequisites
*   Python 3.x installed on your system.
